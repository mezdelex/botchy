        ENTRENCH: Place defenses here asap.
        COUNTERATTACK: Let the enemy conquer this base, and we will take it back once the protection ends. Don't waste defensive lineups here.
        OBSERVE: Take no action but watch carefully. Usually used for bases where we may be attacked, but have sufficient defenses.
        WITHDRAW: Do not place defenses/offenses here. Tactical retreat.
        BOMBARD: Send your lineups to attack immediately. 
        BUZZER BEAT: This is the most critical tag. In Frontline, you have 6 minutes of immunity after capturing a base. This tag means do NOT attack until 6 minutes are left for the daily battle to end. Capturing a base within the last 6 minutes means no defenses are required to keep it!
        FEINT: When our opponent has many strong lineups set to defend a base we want to conquer, we attack early with a few lineups to defeat the majority of their defenses. We only dispatch a few, we never conquer immediately as we follow what's written in buzzer beat. 

        Everyone who won't be online during battle phase your duty is to ✅ ONLY DEFEND ✅ the bases tagged with Entrench. 
        Please 🚫 DO NOT 🚫 take the initiate to attack an enemy base, this will only harm us. This is the most important rule and will ensure us a smooth victory.
        Hidden settings in the lineup tab can optimize your defensive participation. Go to lineups, top right corner click the ratchet wheel ⚙️ next to “quick add” and turn “auto team commands”  “auto convert” on.
        This function will automatically re-place your teams on a base once defeated - even if you are offline.""",

        defeated any offensive or defensive lineups.

        The way it works is by dealing damage equal to 20% Max HP to the opponen'’s lineup but it does'’t defeat it. This will
        greatly impact the damage we deal to super strong lineups. That max hp is shown as a green bar while the energy is shown
        as yellow bar.

        Once enough dynamite has been used the green life will disappear (3rd pic) and at that point any extra dynamite wo'’t
        take effect therefore save for other strong opponents.

        The way to use dynamite is to click on the intelligence tab of each base we are attacking or defending and click on
        use dynamite. When someone attack us the dynamite will be on the left side (4th pic) when we are attacking the dynamite
        will be on the right side (5th pic) with lines no longer than 120 characters.""",
